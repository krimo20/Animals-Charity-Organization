  <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/black-rhino"><p3> <em> Black rhinos </em>  are the smaller of the two African rhino <br> species. 
    The most notable difference between white and black <br> rhinos are their  
     hooked upper lip. This distinguishes them <br>from the white rhino,  
     which has a square lip. Black rhinos are <br>browsers rather  than grazers,  
      and their pointed lip helps them <br>feed on leaves from  bushes and trees.  
      They have two horns, and occasionally a third, small  posterior horn.  
 
    Populations <br>of black rhino declined dramatically in  the 20th century at the  
    hands of European hunters and settlers. Between <br> 1960 and 1995, black rhino  
    numbers dropped by a sobering 98%, <br>  to less than 2,500. Since then, the species  
     has made a tremendous comeback from the brink of extinction. <br> Thanks to   
     persistent conservation efforts across Africa, black rhino numbers have doubled  
      from their historic <br>low 20 years ago to around 5,500 today. <br>However,  
      the black rhino is still considered critically <br>endangered, and a lot of work  
      remains to bring  the numbers <br>up to even a fraction of what it once was—and to  
      ensure that it stays there. Wildlife crime—in this case, poaching and  <br>
      black-market trafficking of rhino horn—continues <br>to plague the species  
      and threaten its recovery</p3> </a>

   <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/climate/polar-bear-extinction.html"><p3>  <em>Polar bears</em> could become nearly extinct by the end of the century as a resul
     of shrinking sea ice in the Arctic if global warming continues unabated, scientists said Monday.

    Nearly all of the 19 subpopulations of polar bears, from the Beaufort Sea off Alaska
     to the Siberian Arctic, would face being wiped out because the loss of sea ice would
      force the animals onto land and away from their food supplies for longer periods, 
      the researchers said. Prolonged fasting, and reduced nursing of cubs by mothers, 
      would lead to rapid declines in reproduction and survival. </p3>
